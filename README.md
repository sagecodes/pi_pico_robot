# Rasperry Pi Pico Robot

Check out the pico robot video in this tweet: [https://twitter.com/sagecodes/status/1584352982912872448](https://twitter.com/sagecodes/status/1584352982912872448)

This repo is currently a work in progress, but it will contain information about building an affordable robot you with a raspberry pi pico to learn about and have fun with micro controllers and robotics.  


## Parts used in my build

- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico Micro controller
- 1x soderless breadboard
- 1 Small battery pack 
- 2x continuous servo motors
- 2x 10k ohm resistors
- 2x 170 ohm resistors
- 2x red L.E.D.s
- 2x cadmium sulfide photocells
- 2 pieces of guitar string


## Programming:
Right now you can check out main.py for some examples of driving the contious servos, blinking LEDs, reading light levels, and reacting to touch sensors with micro python.

I'll likely clean these up and break them out into structured files in the future :)
